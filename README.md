# A Hum[uman Doc]ument: An Interactive CSS Painting

This is a digital encoding of Tom Phillips's *A Humument* using HTML and CSS. 

I was inspired by [Diana Smith's](https://diana-adrianne.com/) series of CSS paintings, completed under the restrictions that:  
1. All elements must be typed out by hand.
2. Only Atom text editor and Chrome Developer Tools allowed.
3. SVG use is limited, and all shapes can only use hand-plotted coordinates and bezier curves, without the aid of any graphics editor.

I initially sought to adhere to Smith's rules, trying to keep the painting "pure." For the purposes of time, sanity, and accurate reproduction, I created SVGs in Adobe Illustrator to create cut paths (or "rivers") through the shapes to reveal the text below.
